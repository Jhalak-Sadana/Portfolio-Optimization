# Portfolio-Optimization (Mean-Variance Optimal Risky Portfolio Using Simulation)


 This project involves the creation of an R function to analyze stock-return data and output mean-variance metrics for a collection of stocks, as well as information about simulated portfolios. The goal is to find the optimal way to structure a portfolio such that it is mean-variance efficient, which is typically the point of tangency in the risky set when a line is plotted between the risk-free rate and feasible portfolios. The project will use the simulation method, whereby portfolios are constructed and compared in mean-variance space using a random sampling of portfolio weights. The optimal portfolio is then chosen based on the highest Sharpe ratio. The project also involves producing a plot of the portfolios and clearly identifying the optimal portfolio and the minimum variance portfolio. The report will include an introduction, a description of the coding approach and results, and a conclusion that explores learnings and additional considerations related to the topic of portfolio optimization.
